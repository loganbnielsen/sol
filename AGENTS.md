# Sol maintainer context

Sol is a pre-alpha software factory for backend systems. The `sol` CLI and platform
are language-neutral; OCaml and TypeScript applications target the same application
and deployment contract.

## Repository map

- `cli/` — the `sol` CLI and typed deployment/lifecycle implementation.
- `framework/` — first-party application framework packages.
- `platform/` — Terraform, Helm values, templates, and other assets driven by Sol.
- `examples/` — runnable reference applications.
- `docs/` — user guidance, reference, and durable architecture.
- `internal/ci/` — executable repository/product guards.
- `internal/qualification/` — live behavioral claims, procedures, and evidence.
- `internal/fixtures/` — test fixtures.

Read the authority nearest the thing you are changing. Do not copy subsystem rules
into this file.

## Development posture

Sol is pre-alpha. There are no compatibility guarantees for current APIs or repository
structure: prefer the correct design over compatibility shims, deprecated aliases, or
version gates. Update callers and tests in the same change.

GitHub Issues and pull requests are the work-state authority. Make every change in a Git
worktree, never by switching the primary checkout off `main`; branch and worktree names
carry no Sol-specific semantics. Open focused PRs, rely on required CI, request review
proportional to risk, and squash-merge. Do not recreate repository-local workflow state
with labels, bots, branch conventions, or custom tooling.

Independent work proceeds concurrently from current `main` in separate worktrees. Do not
wait for an open PR to merge merely because later work depends on it.
For a mechanical dependency, branch the dependent PR from the prerequisite PR's head and
open it against that branch, so its diff contains only its own changes. State the stack
relationship in the PR description. Once the parent merges, retarget and rebase or refresh
the child against `main`, then continue the stack. Use stacking only when the parent is
already the chosen implementation basis; resolve semantic or product-boundary decisions
before building on them. Keep each PR focused and reviewable.

When a PR is complete, validated, and intended to land on its correct base, use auto-merge
or the merge queue where the repository is configured for them, rather than repeatedly
polling CI or waiting synchronously. A stacked child is not ready to land on `main` until
its parent merges and the child is retargeted. Required CI, reviews, branch protection, and
conversation resolution remain authoritative; never bypass them. Resolve failing checks,
conflicts, review findings, and changed parents while independent or downstream work
continues.

## Build and validation

Set up the pinned support packages and dependencies as described in the README, then:

```sh
eval "$(opam env)"
dune build
```

The `*-eio` packages are pinned to the exact commits in `support-refs.txt`. A build
failure inside a framework package (`Https_eio`, `Kafka_eio`, ...) on a fresh checkout is
almost always a stale support-package pin, not a code defect: run
`bash internal/ci/pin-support-packages.sh` and rebuild before investigating further. The
fast checks detect drift and re-pin automatically; set `SOL_SKIP_SUPPORT_PIN=1` to be told
what to run instead.

Run the smallest relevant tests while developing. Before proposing a change, run the
cheap repository checks:

```sh
bash internal/ci/run_fast_checks.sh
```

Required GitHub CI is authoritative for merge. Live cloud qualification is separate from
ordinary development; follow `internal/qualification/README.md` when a claim requires it.
Releases are the deliberate path in `internal/tooling/release/README.md`: a merge never
creates or publishes one, and a published release is the exact artifact that passed
qualification.

A passing rerun does not explain an earlier failure. Preserve the original failure and its
evidence, then find the cause; a rerun that happens to pass is not a diagnosis. Report an
unresolved cause as unresolved rather than as a flake, and fix what you do find at its owning
boundary. Investigate through source, documented contracts and provider documentation before
adding defensive machinery or repeating a live test that costs money, and treat "the implementation
is correct and needs no change" as a valid conclusion. Investigate proportionately: an unexplained
failure is worth recording and carrying as stated risk, not necessarily an open-ended hunt or a
blocker for unrelated work.

## Durable invariants

- Sol owns only its declared contract boundary. Users may integrate arbitrary
  infrastructure against that boundary; Sol neither plans nor manages it.
- Destructive lifecycle decisions fail closed on unknown state. Absence must be
  positively established, and live qualification independently verifies absence.
- The declarative Sol contract is canonical for application/deployment intent; generated
  language bindings and artifacts are projections, not competing authorities.
- Production Kafka uses authenticated, encrypted transport; local development may use
  deliberate plaintext configuration. Do not infer that local and production settings
  must be identical.
- Generated artifacts are outputs. Change their typed/source owner rather than patching
  generated YAML or other projections as the primary implementation.
- Preserve OCaml/TypeScript behavioral contract parity without requiring implementation
  parity.
- Security ambiguity, destructive live actions, and architectural decisions require
  explicit operator judgment. Ordinary implementation work should proceed autonomously.

## Documentation ownership

- `README.md` — product entry point and source-build path.
- `docs/reference/` — current application/CLI contract.
- `docs/guides/` — task-oriented user guidance.
- `docs/architecture/` — current architecture and durable ADRs.
- package-local docs — package-specific public/maintainer contracts.
- `internal/qualification/` — qualification claims, procedures, and evidence.

## Simplicity budget

Repository-wide process or tooling must protect a concrete guarantee that Git, GitHub, or existing
CI does not already provide. Prefer the smallest implementation that correctly fulfills Sol's
declared contract: own only the responsibilities the dependencies do not already handle, and treat
Terraform, Kubernetes and the cloud providers as authoritative in their domains rather than
duplicating their documented behavior with Sol-side validation, reconciliation, retries, watchers or
state. Before adding a guard, abstraction, retry, state file, or process, ask what responsibility it
fulfills, why the dependency cannot fulfill it, and whether simplifying or deleting would solve the
problem instead: complexity is better deleted at its owning boundary than coordinated with more
machinery. When a mechanism goes, keep the guarantee it carried and say which test still establishes
it. Prefer a simpler design or a test at the failure boundary over turning an incident into a
permanent global rule. Historical state belongs in Git and pull requests unless it is a current
product, architecture, or qualification authority.

Preserve the original diagnostics Terraform, Kubernetes and cloud providers emit, including error
codes and messages. Add concise Sol context when it helps, but do not replace, obscure or
speculatively reinterpret the underlying error, and redact sensitive values where necessary.

History belongs in Git and pull requests, not current instructions. If prose conflicts
with executable behavior, verify the implementation and fix or remove the stale prose
rather than adding another authority.
