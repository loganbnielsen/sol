# {{Name}}

A Sol workspace with two services: `charge_svc` (HTTP) and `notify_worker` (Kafka consumer).

## Prerequisites

System packages required before building:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y librdkafka-dev libpq-dev libpq5
```

The Sol framework is an ordinary opam dependency, declared in `{{basename}}.opam`
alongside the rest of this workspace's dependencies. Nothing is vendored into
this directory, and the workspace has no knowledge of where Sol's source lives.

- **Released framework:** `opam install . --deps-only` resolves the version you
  declare in `{{basename}}.opam`.
- **Development framework (tracking Sol `main`):** install the framework from a
  Sol checkout, which makes your switch satisfy the declared dependency:

  ```bash
  bash /path/to/sol/platform/local/scripts/prepare-framework-deps.sh
  ```

  That is Sol's own bootstrap — the same one the Sol repository's CI runs — so
  there is one definition of the development switch rather than a list of pins
  copied into every workspace.

## Build

```bash
eval $(opam env)
dune build
```

## Schema compatibility in CI

Set the GitHub Actions secret `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL` to the registry containing
the published schema history. The generated `sol-ci.yml` runs `dune runtest`
against it and fails when the URL is absent or compatibility cannot be checked.
On a developer machine, `dune runtest` visibly skips this check when the URL
is unset.

## Run locally

```bash
sol local deploy     # establish local cluster + infra, build images, deploy (~5 min first run)
sol local run        # run all workspace services locally (dune exec, dev env vars)
```

## Deploy to cluster

```bash
sol local deploy          # build images and deploy to cluster
sol migrate     # apply database migrations
sol rollback    # roll back all services to previous image
```

## Container images

Each unit's `Dockerfile` is a two-stage build:

- **Builder** -- `ocaml/opam:ubuntu-24.04-ocaml-5.4`, so the binary links against
  glibc 2.39, with the `librdkafka`/`libpq`/`libssl`/`libgmp` development packages
  installed.
- **Runtime** -- `ubuntu:24.04` with the matching runtime libraries only.

Dependencies are not listed in the Dockerfile. The builder reproduces the
environment this workspace declares in `{{basename}}.opam`
(`opam install --deps-only .`), so the workspace owns its dependency choices and
the Dockerfile only reconstructs them. That is why no Sol repository appears in
it: the framework packages carry their own `pin-depends` for anything not yet in
the public opam-repository (DEC-025; see Prerequisites above).

Three details are deliberate:

- `opam repository set-url default https://opam.ocaml.org` runs before the
  install. The base image's default remote is a local snapshot frozen when the
  image was built, which can predate a version a dependency needs (observed with
  `https-eio` needing `tls-eio >= 2.1.0`, unsatisfiable against that snapshot even
  after `opam update`). CI initialises a fresh index and never hits this.
- `{{basename}}.opam` is copied before the source, so the dependency layer stays
  cached independently of source changes.
- The image runs as uid 65534 (`nobody`), matching the `securityContext` Sol
  renders into the Kubernetes manifests. Change one without the other and the
  running workload no longer matches what the manifests declare.

The build context is the workspace root -- this directory, the one holding
`sol.yml` -- which is what `sol local deploy` uses. To build one image by hand:

```bash
docker build -f app/payments/charge_svc/Dockerfile -t charge-svc .
```

`sol local deploy` copies this root into a temporary build context first (excluding
`_build/` and `.git/`, as `.dockerignore` does). Symlinks are copied as
symlinks, exactly as Docker itself treats them: a link is never followed, so a
link that points outside the workspace stays a link rather than importing the
external file's contents into the context.

## Project layout

```
sol.yml                   ← workspace manifest (identifies this as a Sol workspace)
events/payments/          ← Charged event contract (payments team owns)
app/payments/charge_svc/  ← HTTP service (publishes Charged on POST /charges)
app/comms/notify_worker/  ← Kafka consumer (subscribes to Charged)
lib/                      ← shared storage module (used by svc and worker)
db/migrations/            ← SQL migration files
  *.sql                   ← forward migrations
  *.down.sql              ← rollback migrations (used by `sol migrate rollback`)
test/                     ← schema backward-compatibility CI gate
  test_schemas.ml
  dune
.dockerignore             ← excludes _build/ and .git/ from Docker build context
sol/secrets.local/        ← ignored per-unit credentials for local run and deploy
{{basename}}.opam              ← declares the Sol framework dependency (DEC-025)
```

This workspace's directory, OCaml module names, and SQL identifiers use the
OCaml-safe form `{{name}}` (lowercased, `-` → `_`). Kubernetes namespaces and
object names use the hyphenated form (`_` → `-`), e.g. `{{name}}-payments`; the
mapping is applied automatically.
