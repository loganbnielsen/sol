(* The provider-neutral bootstrap-window capability surface.

   Sol installs the privileged platform under a temporary cluster-admin
   elevation. On every provider the window is established by the same question
   -- can the installing identity escalate and bind ClusterRoles? -- and its
   removal is demonstrated by the same successor question. Only how a provider
   obtains cluster access differs, so the capability surface and its
   interpretation live here rather than in each provider module. *)
