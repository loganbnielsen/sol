    It runs once per target, after the deploy prerequisites and before the migration
    Job: with the database's administrative credential, it creates the DDL and DML roles
    with Sol-generated passwords and writes their credentials to the target's Secrets.

    The step is part of the *provisioning path*, not a consumer: it receives the master
    for the duration of one Job and never appears in the class model as a role. *)

(** Idempotent by construction: re-running against a target whose roles exist is a no-op
    in value — the passwords come from the existing Secret, so the [ALTER] re-applies the
    same value rather than churning it.

    **Where the passwords come from — and why this is a file, not [-c].** psql does *not*
    interpolate [:'variable'] inside a dollar-quoted block: the server receives the
    literal text and reports a syntax error. Verified against PostgreSQL 16. So the
    values are read from the environment with [\getenv] — not from argv (which is visible
    in the process list) and not from the script text (which would put them in the
    manifest) — and the block uses [current_setting] to reach them. That requires the
    script on stdin or [-f]; [-c] cannot carry this. The Job's [env:] feeds
    [SOL_DDL_PASSWORD] and [SOL_DML_PASSWORD] from the transient Secret, exactly as it
    feeds the master connection string.

    [set_config] returns the value it set, so the selects project [IS NOT NULL]: without
    it psql prints the password to stdout and the Job's logs capture it. Verified the
    same way.

    **The grants belong here, not in the migrations.** The migration runs as
    [sol_migrator] and creates the schema's objects, so [ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES] for
    that role is what makes everything it later creates reachable by [sol_app]. On
    PostgreSQL 15 and later [public] grants no [CREATE] to [PUBLIC], so [sol_migrator]
    needs it explicitly or the migration cannot create anything. *)
