(* The executable guard for the ownership rule (docs/architecture/ownership.md): a label
   selects what to look at, only the live UID recorded at apply authorizes a removal. These
   tests drive the removal paths themselves (Sol_cli_rollback.prune_workloads and
   Sol_cli_workload_scope.release_workloads), not just the ownership predicate, so a revert
   to label-based selection fails here even though the predicate would still pass. Verified
   by negative control: making both paths label-based fails both tests.

   Run it through dune — `dune build @ci-unit` (what CI runs) or
   `dune build @cli/test/inline/runtest`. Do not invoke the generated
   `inline-test-runner.exe` by hand after a plain `dune build`: the runner is only built by
   the `runtest` alias, so a bare build leaves the previous binary in place and a real
   regression would read as a pass. CI is `opam exec -- dune build @ci-unit`, which rebuilds
   the runner from the changed library, so the guard cannot be masked there. *)
