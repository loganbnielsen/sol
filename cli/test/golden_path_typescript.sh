# fulfillment_worker subscribes with `fromBeginning: false`
# (app code, out of scope to change here). For a genuinely new
# consumer group -- exactly what a fresh cluster's first-ever
# deploy creates -- that means "start from the tail": a message
# produced before the group finishes joining is not delayed, it
# is invisible to it forever. This job's first real run hit
# exactly this: POST /orders succeeded at a timestamp 8.8s
# *before* the worker's own log showed "[ConsumerGroup] Consumer
# has joined the group", so the message landed in a topic no
# consumer had subscribed to yet, and no retry budget on the
# Postgres check downstream could ever have found it.
#
# A Kubernetes-level `kubectl wait --for=condition=ready` cannot
# establish this (verified experimentally, see git history on
# this file): the worker Deployment has no readiness probe, so
# that condition means "container started," nothing more. The
# only real signal is the application's own evidence that it
# joined -- so wait on that directly, the same "poll for the
# actual observed effect" pattern `probe()` below uses for HTTP.
# The wait itself must not be fragile. This step runs under
# `set -o pipefail`, and `kubectl logs ... | grep -q PATTERN`
# reports *no match* whenever PATTERN appears early in a stream
# larger than the pipe buffer: `grep -q` exits at the first match,
# kubectl keeps writing into a now-closed pipe, and pipefail
# propagates kubectl's SIGPIPE exit (141) out of the whole
# pipeline -- so the success case reads as a miss. Reproduced
# locally: a 2,000,000-line producer with the pattern on line 2
# returned NOMATCH. Capture the logs first, then match with a
# herestring, so no pipeline is involved and no exit status can
# come from anything but grep.
