"""Independent, read-only AWS residue observation for a qualification target.

The AWS row harness destroys a target through Sol's public lifecycle
(``sol destroy <target> --apply``) and must then decide, independently of
Sol, whether the target's disposable resources are actually gone. Sol's destroy
exit code, its Terraform state and Sol's own absence report are not that
decision; this module makes the decision from provider reads alone.

Every required disposable class gets one read, an expected JSON shape and an
attribution predicate that says which returned resources belong to *this*
target (its cluster tag, its cluster-name prefix, or its registry path). A
class is:

  * ABSENT  -- the read succeeded, its shape was the expected one, and no live
               resource in the class is attributable to the target;
  * PRESENT -- the read succeeded and at least one attributable resource is
               live residue;
  * UNKNOWN -- the read failed, timed out, returned something that was not JSON,
               did not have the expected shape, or could not be attributed to
               the target.

UNKNOWN is never absence. A required class that is UNKNOWN or PRESENT fails the
verdict, so an unreadable provider response cannot be read as a clean teardown.

The reads enumerate a whole class in the region and filter in this process,
rather than trusting a server-side tag filter: an empty tag search is not proof
of absence when the query itself might be wrong. Attribution then has to hold
after the target has disappeared, so it is derived from the target's declared
identities (``kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster>`` tags, the cluster-name prefix in
resource names, the target's registry path) and never from live containment.

Durable prerequisites and explicitly retained resources are observed
separately and are excluded from the residue verdict: a delegation zone or a
state bucket outliving the target is the contract, not residue.

Usage:
    absence.py collect --dir D --cluster C --region R --account A
                       [--registry-prefix P] [--base-domain B]
                       [--retention none|final-snapshot]
