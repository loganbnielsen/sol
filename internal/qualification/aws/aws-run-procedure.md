# AWS live qualification

Live AWS qualification requires explicit operator authorization before billable resources are created. The owning claim contract is `production-single-region-v1-matrix.md`; this procedure is operational guidance, not a second verdict store.

## AWS live qualification procedure

This procedure maps the current AWS matrix to the reference application and live provider observations. A run is evidence only for rows it actually exercises.

### Production identities

Earlier procedure text precondition 3 names **four** IAM roles (provisioner, publisher, deploy, operator).
The bootstrap root emits **five** policy documents and the Run 8 target declares **five**
identities; `cluster_access_policy_json` / `aws.cluster_access_role_arn` — the DEC-034 split
between cloud-substrate mutation and steady-state platform management — is the one earlier runs
omitted. The run's precondition is:

| Identity | Bootstrap output | Target field | Owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| provisioner | `provisioner_policy_json` | `aws.provisioner_role_arn` | cloud substrate mutation; access-entry / policy association |
| cluster-access | `cluster_access_policy_json` | `aws.cluster_access_role_arn` | steady-state platform management |
| deploy | `deploy_policy_json` | `aws.deploy_role_arn` | application / release mutation, namespace-scoped |
| operator | `operator_policy_json` | `aws.operator_role_arn` | read-only diagnostics |
| publisher | `publisher_policy_json` | — (never a target field) | ECR push only, on its own assume-role session |

The qualification transport principal is a **sixth** identity, created by the harness for the
transport only (`internal/qualification/transport/`), never named by a target field
(DEC-039 §3). Earlier procedure text step 10 "four-identity check" is read as five for The run.

### Alpha row reconciliation (the run's scope)

The workload is the frozen reference scenario, implemented by `FEAT-131`/`FEAT-132` in the
OCaml namespace; the TypeScript namespace is not in the production profile (DEC-026 §2).
The harness binds the scenario through `SVC_UNIT`/`WORKER_UNIT` (with their directories
`SVC_DIR`/`WORKER_DIR`), `APP_NS`/`WORKER_NS`, `APP_SERVICE`, `APP_PORT` and `SCENARIO`. The
pre-campaign shape is the default (`charge_svc`/`notify_worker`, `charges`); the alpha binding
is `SVC_UNIT=orders_svc WORKER_UNIT=fulfilment_worker APP_SERVICE=orders-svc SCENARIO=orders`
(with `SVC_DIR=payments`, `WORKER_DIR=comms`, `APP_NS=pluto-payments`, `WORKER_NS=pluto-comms`
unless `FEAT-131`/`FEAT-132` land different names — then the binding values change, not the
mechanism). The alpha rows whose target includes `aws`, and the AWS matrix rows that carry them:

| Alpha row | Capability | AWS matrix row(s) | The run |

| — | Delivered-and-acknowledged alert (AWS matrix G1–G3) | G1–G3 | **BLOCKED**: a real receiver and an owner who acknowledges |

Rows the run does not reach stay `NOT RUN` in the record; they are not inferred from a later
command's output.

### Prerequisites (all present before any billable resource is created)

**Environment**

1. A fresh, disposable, isolated AWS account and an unexpired SSO session for the operator's
   profile (`aws sts get-caller-identity` names the qualification account).
2. `aws`, `terraform` ≥ 1.5, `kubectl`, `dig`, `jq`, `python3`; `docker` reachable from the
   shell that runs the app phase (`docker version` succeeds, or run under `sg docker -c`).
   `opam` + `dune` are needed only if the runner is built from source rather than taken from
   the release.
3. The **released bundle** (`RELEASE-006`): `sol-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` extracted,
   `SOL_HOME` unset, `sol --version` reports the tag, `sol assets` reports every asset
   present. `SOL=<bundle>/bin/sol` selects it for the harness.
4. Runtime inputs, never in the repository: `TF_VAR_db_password` (≥ 8 characters, no `/`,
   `@`, `"`), `SOL_API_KEY`, and `POSTGRES_URL` with the password percent-encoded. The
   harness reads `POSTGRES_URL` from the cluster root's own `postgres_url` output.
5. The durable bootstrap root applied: the state bucket and lock table, and the delegated
   `qual-aws.sol-fab.dev` zone with `manage_dns_zone=true`. The zone is durable and outlives
   the target.
6. The five IAM roles created by the operator from that root's generated policy documents
   (`terraform output -raw <name>_policy_json`), each used on its own session — the publisher
   on a session used by nothing else. Sol owns the policy contracts, never the role
   lifecycle.
7. The qualification transport role (a name the harness is given, never a target field).
8. A target file `examples/pluto/sol/environments.local.yml` copied from
   `run8-aws-target.example.yml` with real values. It is untracked by design, so the record
   carries its contents or a hash plus its path. It declares `profile: production-single-region`,
   the five role ARNs, `kube_context`, the registry, `cluster_endpoint_cidr` (never
   `0.0.0.0/0`), `node_failure_headroom_nodes`, `destroy_retention: none`, and the two
   TypeScript units omitted. The alert fields are required by the profile preflight; they are
   set to a real receiver only when pursuing G1–G3, and the run records G as blocked otherwise.
9. Explicit operator authorization for the live run and the release
   version (§7.6).

### Expected resources and cost-bearing steps

Billable from `sol cloud apply` until the independent inventory is `ABSENT`; the cost rule is
absolute (tear down before asking). The target creates, at least:

| Resource class | Declared by | Teardown class |
|---|---|---|
| EKS cluster + control plane | cluster root (`kubernetes_version` 1.36) | cluster |
| Managed node group, 4 × `m6i.xlarge` desired | cluster root | cluster |
| RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ, `db.t4g.small`, engine 16.15 | cluster root | database (plus its snapshots) |
| VPC, subnets, route tables, one NAT gateway + EIPs | cluster root | network |
| EBS volumes (PVCs, node root disks) | storage class / PVCs | storage |
| Application/ingress load balancer | platform (ingress) | load balancer |
| ECR repositories | cluster/platform root + the runner repository the harness creates | registry (empty after teardown) |
| CloudWatch log groups | platform | logs |
| Route 53 `qual-aws.sol-fab.dev` | durable bootstrap root | **retained** (durable, not a target resource) |

The nodes dominate the hourly cost; the run's own gate is the operator's authorization, and
the destroy is part of the run, not a follow-up. A run that stops early is still destroyed.

### The run, phase by phase

`internal/qualification/aws/live-row.sh <phase>` orchestrates Sol's public commands and reads
provider/Kubernetes state independently. It never invokes `terraform` or `helm` for a target
phase: `cloud` reconciles the *durable* bootstrap root (the operator's prerequisite) with
`terraform`, and every disposable-target step goes through Sol. `SOL` selects the released
bundle.

**`cloud`** — reconcile the durable root; `sol cloud plan <target> --var-file <tfvars>`;
`sol cloud apply <target> --var-file <tfvars>` (the row's `qual-aws-row.tfvars`); build the
deploy/access/operator kubeconfigs; capture nodes and the cluster root state. The profile emits
its `-var` arguments after the var file, so the profile still wins on every variable it sets.
Evidence: `bootstrap.log`, `cloud-plan.log`, `cloud-apply.log`, `k8s-nodes.txt`,
`state/cloud.tfstate`, and the verbatim `lifecycle phase:` line per invocation. Rows: I1, I2,
I4, A, F1, F2.

**`transport`** — probe the production identities for `pods/portforward` (must answer `no`),
establish the qualification transport
(`internal/qualification/transport/establish.sh <cluster> <qualifier-role> <region> <namespace>`),
record the qualifier's own `auth whoami` session, probe the production identities again, and
confirm the qualifier can open the transport. Evidence:
`transport-separation-pre.txt`, `transport-establish.log`, `transport-whoami.json`,
`transport-separation-post.txt`. Rows: E7, INFRA-060 criterion 5, DEC-039 §4. The record names
the transport identity separately from the identities under qualification, and shows none of
the latter holds `pods/portforward` before or after.

**`app`** — the publisher's work, then Sol's: build and push the workload images, publish the
migration runner (below), set the runtime secrets, `sol migrate apply <target>`,
`sol deploy <target> --registry <registry> --image-tag <tag>`, then drive the representative
transaction through the transport (`transport-transaction.sh`, port-forward to the private
`ClusterIP`). Evidence: `app-transaction.log`, `transport-port-forward.log`,
`transport-transaction.txt`, `k8s-pods.txt`, `state/cloud.tfstate`. Rows: B1, B3, B4, C1–C6,
D1, D4, D5, F2, F6–F8. The read-back is the application's own effect — the worker's row
visible to the service — never broker progress (DEC-039 §5).

**`destroy`** — capture both roots' state with `terraform state pull` into the bundle, run
`sol cloud destroy <target> --apply`, then the independent inventory. **`verify`** runs the
inventory alone. Rows: I3, I5, I7–I9, H6.

### VERIF-021 — managed secret projection and the fenced grant (alpha E4, E6)

This is a live cell of DEC-029's driver × runtime table, run inside the target so the
substrate is shared. The CSI driver and the AWS provider are **not** Sol platform components
(`docs/deployment/compatibility.md` records them as candidates); the run installs them out of
band, as `VERIF-020` did for Vault, and records the chart and provider versions.

1. Reconcile the declared secret grant with `sol grants plan <target>` / `apply <target>`
   (DEC-062, `FEAT-127`), so the unit has a real fenced identity.
2. Create a `SecretProviderClass` with `provider: aws` for a Secrets Manager secret under the
   environment's path, and confirm the provider authenticates as the **pod's** identity
   (IRSA / EKS Pod Identity), never the node's.
3. A granted unit reads the value; remove the unit's grant and confirm the read is
   `AccessDenied` while a granted read still succeeds.
4. `enableSecretRotation` updates the mounted file within the stated bound; measure the
   rotation-to-file-change delay. A new pod fails closed while the authority is unavailable;
   a running pod keeps its last-known value.
5. DEC-062 rule 6: run `aws iam simulate-principal-policy` against the unit's role for an
   allowed and a denied action, including a permissions boundary, and compare with a real
   call. Record on `DEC-062` whether the simulation reflects boundaries, resource policies
   and SCPs; if it does not, the deploy-time verification (`FEAT-128`) needs a mechanism that
   does.

Evidence: the exact commands and outputs, the provider/CSI versions, the measured delay, and
the DEC-029 cell verdicts.

### VERIF-022 — projected ServiceAccount tokens (alpha E5) — blocked on implementation

`VERIF-022` qualifies the DEC-063 mechanism: a projected ServiceAccount token volume with
`audience: <callee unit>` and `expirationSeconds: 3600`; no Kubernetes API access; issuer
discovery; caller/`calls`-graph authorization (`401`/`403`/wrong-`aud`); key rotation; and
refresh without restart.

**It cannot be collected in The run today, and the blocker is implementation, not
authorization.** The callee-side generic JWT verification exists
(`framework/ocaml/sol-svc/lib/auth.ml`, `Jwks_url` + JWKS fetching), but DEC-063's mechanism
is absent from the tree: no Kubernetes `serviceAccountToken` projected volume is rendered
(`rg -n 'serviceAccountToken|expirationSeconds' cli/ framework/` finds no projected volume;
the manifest builder only sets `automountServiceAccountToken: false`), and the caller API
`Service.call` and the `calls`-graph authorization do not exist (`rg -n 'Service\.call'
framework/ cli/` finds nothing). `FEAT-134` implements DEC-063's already-decided API; the
pluto `calls` edge it updates is `payments/charge_svc` → `checkout/checkout_svc`. Until that
lands, E5 is `BLOCKED` — recorded as blocked, never weakened.

### Failure injections (each is a scenario, not an accident)

| Row | Injection | Observable |
|---|---|---|
| B4 | deploy a workload that cannot become ready (bad probe/image) | deploy exits non-zero; the prior release stays authoritative; pods unchanged |
| B6 | roll back across a `contract` migration | refused, naming the migration boundary; pointer unchanged |
| C2 | add a migration file without applying it, then deploy | deploy fails closed naming the missing migration; no workload mutated |
| C3 | edit an applied migration, then `sol migrate status` / deploy | the checksum mismatch is reported |
| D5, H1 | produce an undecodable record to the worker's topic | structured decode log, `sol_worker_decode_errors_total`, a DLQ record on `<topic>.<group>.dlq` with the raw bytes, and the source offset advancing |
| H2 | make the broker unreachable, then restore it | the relay holds; recovery publishes; a relay restart preserves `ord` order |
| H4/D3 | terminate a node's EC2 instance with no drain | measured time from `NotReady` to required ready capacity restored; PASS iff ≤ 300 s |
| H5/E5/E6 | produce N `acks=all` messages, kill one broker | none lost; measured consumer auto-resume ≤ 60 s |
| H6/E2–E4 | `aws rds reboot-db-instance --force-failover`; PITR restore into a clean target | measured RTO/RPO within the matrix bounds; the app serves a transaction after each |
| H7/E10 | stop the telemetry backend | the app is unaffected; the telemetry gap is recorded, with no business-data claim |
| I10 | stop the platform install partway, then `sol cloud destroy --apply` | the destroy succeeds and enters `PreparingDestroy`; no out-of-band deletion |
| I12 | interrupt a destroy between preparation and destruction, then re-run | the second run completes without reusing the first attempt's snapshot identity |

### Teardown and independent absence verification

1. `terraform state pull` for both the cluster and platform roots into the evidence bundle
   **before** any teardown (ledger rule 4).
2. `sol cloud destroy <target> --apply`; capture every `lifecycle phase:` line and the
   terraform argv (I7's `-var` order, I8's targeted preparation, I9's `Destroying` → `Absent`).
3. Independent inventory, tri-state `PRESENT` / `ABSENT` / `UNKNOWN`, over EKS clusters, RDS
   instances and snapshots, EC2 instances, VPCs, NAT gateways, EIPs, EBS volumes, ELBv2 load
   balancers, ECR repositories and CloudWatch log groups. A failed or unreadable read is
   `UNKNOWN`, never absence. The matrix's H6 classes are the set; the matrix's "assertions that
   ride along" requires the absence checks to have been seen to fail against a real residual.
4. Confirm the durable Route 53 zone and its nameservers are unchanged, and that no snapshot,
   bucket, address or volume is retained (`retention: none`).
5. Re-run `sol cloud destroy <target> --apply` against the now-`Absent` target: exit 0,
   `Absent`, no preparation (I11).

### Released-bundle interface (RELEASE-006, landed)

`RELEASE-006` part A moved the AWS and GCP harnesses onto the installed bundle and pinned it
with a harness test. The run uses that interface: `SOL_INSTALL` is the extracted prefix,
`SOL_HOME` is unset, `sol --version` equals the bundle version, the released platform bundle
lives under `share/sol/<version>/platform`, and the bundle's
`share/sol/<version>/migration-runner-image` pins the migration runner **by digest**. The
harness does not publish a runner and hands Sol no runner reference; an installed Sol refuses
`SOL_MIGRATION_RUNNER_IMAGE` because a release uses only its own assets (DEC-049). The harness
records the bundle version and that digest in `sol-identity.txt`. The run does not start against a
checkout build: the artifact a user installs is the thing under qualification (J3).

### What The run does not establish

- The delivered-and-acknowledged alert (AWS matrix G1–G3) without a real receiver and an owner.
- Alpha E5 (`VERIF-022`) until `FEAT-134` lands, and the DEC-063 mechanism on `gcp`/`byo`.
- The TypeScript production profile (DEC-026 §2), GCP, `byo`, `self_hosted_durable` /
  `external` observability, zone-failure tolerance, multi-team RBAC, admission policy,
  federation, and signing/SBOM (the matrix's section J).
- Any row it does not reach: those stay `NOT RUN` with the reason, never promoted.
