"""A delegated DNS zone is a durable prerequisite, on every provider (DEC-042/DEC-043).

The zone's authoritative nameservers are baked into a registrar delegation Sol cannot repair
programmatically, so recreating the zone silently breaks resolution. The decided contract --
applied to GCP under HARDEN-004, mirrored for AWS with the same qualification-shaped interim
mechanism -- is that the zone is owned by the durable bootstrap root rather than by
disposable target state, that the target only reads a zone that already exists, and that a
plan which would replace or destroy a durable resource is refused rather than applied.

This guard reads both providers and fails closed: each bootstrap root owns its zone behind a
managing flag and keeps that ownership in a remote backend; each cluster root owns a zone
only when told to create one, reads an existing one otherwise, and carries no wildcard
authority that would hide the difference; each qualification target selects the durable zone;
each qualification harness delegates durable reconciliation to Sol's inline whole-target
deploy; and each absence verifier reports the retained zone as the declared prerequisite
rather than as residue.
