"""A workload can reach the managed database Sol provisioned, and only on that path (FND-0075).

The invariant, stated semantically: a workload whose target declares a Sol-managed database gets
egress to the network range required to reach that database, on the database port — derived from
the placement Sol owns, never declared by an application author, and never widened beyond it.

That means, structurally: both providers enforce NetworkPolicy (otherwise the contract is not
exercised at all, which is how the GCP row passed while AWS hung); each cluster root derives the
range from the resource it created and publishes it; each platform root mirrors the variable; the
shared module publishes it as a cluster fact with a read grant narrow enough to fetch that one
object; and the deploy applies the allowance only when the fact carries ranges, only to those
ranges, and only on the database port.
