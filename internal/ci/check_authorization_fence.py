"""The authorization fence is mandatory in the Terraform that creates it (DEC-062 rule 2).

DEC-062 permits exactly one identity to mutate workload authority: a reconciler
whose authority is fenced so that, even holding `iam:CreateRole`, it can only
create a Sol workload role under the environment's path with the boundary
attached, and can never replace that boundary or mutate an identity outside the
environment. On GCP the reconciler is limited to resource-scoped `setIamPolicy`
on Sol-managed secrets and creates no service accounts.

The fence's live behaviour is qualified separately (VERIF-021). This guard holds
the structural half so an edit that removes the condition, widens the resource,
drops the deny, or grants a service-account/role-creation permission fails here.
