# Deploy and recover

Sol owns the operations it starts: planning a change, reconciling a deployment,
verifying workload readiness, restoring a recorded application release, and
removing a declared environment. It does not provide a second interface for
routine diagnosis of a running system.

## Deploy

```bash
sol check
sol plan <target>
sol deploy <target>
```

`sol check` validates the workspace, including generated contract freshness. `--scope` narrows declaration and workload findings; generated contract freshness is always checked workspace-wide.

`sol deploy` verifies the resulting workload rollout and reports failures from
the underlying provider or Kubernetes operation with Sol context. A successful
deploy reports its release identifier. Use `sol releases` to find retained
release identifiers for rollback.

For ongoing diagnosis, use the installed system's tools: Kubernetes for
workload and event details, Grafana/Loki/Prometheus for telemetry, and the cloud
provider for managed resources. Sol's deployment result establishes whether its
own operation reached the required postconditions; it is not a replacement for
those systems' operational interfaces.

## Roll back an application release

```bash
sol releases --target <target>
sol rollback <release-id> --target <target>
```

Rollback restores the immutable application release boundary and verifies the
live workloads before advancing the current-release pointer. It refuses when
release ownership or migration compatibility cannot be established. Application
rollback does not roll back database state.

## Remove an environment

```bash
sol destroy <target>             # inspect the plan
sol destroy <target> --apply     # authorize removal
```

Destroy removes Sol-owned workloads before their substrate and independently
verifies absence. It fails closed when state or ownership is unknown. Installation
resources have a separate lifetime and are removed with `sol uninstall`.

## Database migrations and secrets

Migration and secret commands remain available while their replacement workflows
are designed. See the [migration guide](deployment.md) and
[secret reference](../reference/substrate.md) for their current contracts.
