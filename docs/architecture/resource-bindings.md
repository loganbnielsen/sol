# Resource bindings

**Audience:** Contributors changing how a resource's connection reaches a unit or a generated Job.
**Scope:** The durable model — what a unit requires, how a target resolves it, who may read it, and how
a runtime delivers it. Implementation reality (provider defects, the `@platform` migration sequence,
the delivery support matrix) lives in the issues; this document states the model.

---

## 0. The model

> **A unit declares its dependencies and application secrets. The target resolves their sources. The
> runtime delivers exactly the inputs that unit requires.**

The standard for an ordinary case: **declaring a dependency is enough for Sol to provision it, connect
it, and operate it.** A developer configures exceptions and supplies their own application values.

| Situation | The developer supplies | Sol handles |
|---|---|---|
| Sol-managed database or Kafka | A resource declaration and `uses` | Provisioning, appropriate credentials, connection wiring |
| Application API key | The key's name and value | Authoritative storage, scoped delivery, explicit activation |
| Existing external database or Kafka | A complete connection binding and credential references | Delivery to declared consumers |
| A future runtime | The same dependency and application-secret declarations | Runtime-specific access, retrieval and initialization |

Derived rules, used throughout:

- **Dependency-scoped delivery.** A unit receives an input only for a dependency it declared, or because
  it declared the application secret itself.
- **One producer per input.** Conflicting producers fail at plan; no precedence and no last-value-wins.
- **One writer per delivered object.**
- **Atomic selection.** An override replaces a resource's whole binding selection.
- **Planning selects the source; execution obtains the value.**
- **Honest failure.** Uncertainty, absence and partial success are reported as such.

## 1. Requirements

Nothing new is introduced. Requirements are declared where they already are:

```yaml
# sol.yml
resources:
  app_db:
    type: postgres
services:
  charge_svc:
    uses: [app_db]
```

```toml
# app/payments/charge_svc/sol.toml
[infra.env]
secrets = ["SOL_API_KEY"]
```

**The resource name is the identity, used end to end** — declaration, binding, delivery, evidence.
`uses` is the dependency edge. Resource *shape* (`type`, keys, indexes) belongs in `sol.yml`; an
environment or target may adjust sizing, omission, and the **binding selection**.

## 2. Resolved connections

A **binding** is an entry in the existing deployment plan — not a new configuration object.

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Resource identity** | The declared name and type, preserved for evidence and diagnostics |
| **Ownership** | Sol provisions the resource, or it is externally managed |
| **Credential source** | Where each authoritative value comes from — the provisioning configuration and its output, or an external store with a remote path |
| **Connection contract** | The complete set of inputs a consumer needs in order to connect, **carrying the credential-class dimension, with a source declared per class** (§3), and expressed in the model's own terms — brokers, authentication, password, trust, schema registry — not in delivery names |
| **Delivery** | How the value reaches *this* consumer (§4) |

The connection contract is complete, or it is not a contract: credentials without endpoints describe
nothing connectable, and today's Kafka endpoints are fixed Redpanda addresses in the renderer, so a
credential-only binding would authenticate to one system and connect to another.

**The model owns the connection semantics and the source references; the renderer consumes them.**
`keys:` — the map from an application contract key (`POSTGRES_URL`, `KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD`) to a remote
path — **stays in the plan**: it is the application's own interface, and it is the contract keys that
name the inputs a unit reads. Moving the *type* into the deployment model does not move the mapping.
The reverse dependency (the deployment model depending on a renderer-owned secret-source type) is the
defect this replaces.

**Planning selects the source; execution obtains the value.** A plan names `app_db`'s provisioning
output without containing it, and an external reference is valid without the planner reading the
secret. Plans, records, GitOps output and diagnostics carry **references and non-secret metadata**,
never confidential values. A **pending source** (declared, not yet created) and an **invalid
requirement** (no declared resource) are different outcomes, with different diagnostics.

**Overrides are atomic, at the selection boundary.** Ownership, the credential sources and the
connection contract form one value inside the resource configuration; an override replaces it whole,
while unrelated attributes (type, size, indexes) keep field-level merging. Replacing the whole resource
would discard an inherited type; field-merging the selection could pair an inherited source with a new
connection.

**Provisioning follows effective declarations; delivery follows consumer requirements.** The two must
agree for a target, but neither derives from the other. Migration and contract Jobs are consumers with
internally declared, named dependencies. **Removing a `uses` edge removes that unit's inputs and never
deletes the resource.**

## 3. Authoritative storage and access ownership

Three decisions, related but not interchangeable:

| Decision | Values |
|---|---|
| **Who manages the resource** | Sol provisions it, or it is externally managed |
| **Where its credential comes from** | The provisioning configuration and its output, or an external store |
| **How the unit receives it** | Whatever the runtime delivers (§4) |

### 3.1 Authoritative storage, stated rather than implied

**A Sol-managed application secret is currently stored in the Kubernetes Secret that `sol secret set`
writes; there is no other authoritative store for it.** The provisioning path's credential authority
is the target's provisioning configuration and its output. So a "Sol-managed secret" today means
"stored in Kubernetes" — a fact this document states rather than leaves implicit.

**Provider-store-backed Sol-managed secrets are future work, tracked separately (#1360), and require an
ADR**: a provider secret store for managed targets would change storage durability, GitOps handling and
`sol secret set`'s failure modes, and needs IAM wiring for every writer and reader. It is a decision,
not a clarification. #1344d does not depend on it.

Whatever the store, **one secret has exactly one authoritative source**, and every projection of it is a
representation.

### 3.2 Access ownership: the consumer's role determines its credential class

Dependency-scoped delivery answers *who receives a credential*. It does not answer *what that
credential authorizes*. Today the provisioning output is the database's **administrative** credential,
so delivering it to declared consumers would hand ordinary workloads administrative access.

| Credential class | Held by | Delivered? |
|---|---|---|
| **Provisioning** (administrative) | Sol's provisioning path | **Never delivered to a consumer** |
| **DDL** (schema changes) | The migration Job | To the migration Job only |
| **DML** (ordinary operations) | Application workloads | To declared consumers |

**The class is derived from the consumer's role, not declared by the user.** The migration Job is
Sol-generated and workloads are units, so the class falls out of what Sol already knows. There is no
permission DSL and no new declaration.

- **A workload never receives the provisioning or DDL credential** — even when the database is bound and
  the workload consumes it, the class it receives is DML.
- **A unit cannot request a higher class.** A genuine need for a consumer requiring more is a new
  consumer *kind*, not a new user-facing declaration.

A resource therefore has one identity and several consumer credentials, one per class — which is the
model's "one writer per delivered object" rule applied per class.

### 3.3 Ownership transitions

**Changing a binding never authorizes destroying or relinquishing the previous database.** With
`count = var.create_rds ? 1 : 0`, switching an existing resource to externally managed would take its
database out of Terraform's desired configuration. v1 **refuses an ownership transition for an existing
managed resource** until the operator handles its disposition through the existing lifecycle. No
migration controller is introduced.

## 4. Runtime delivery

The binding is the contract; the runtime is the mechanism, chosen per consumer and runtime — one
resource may serve a Kubernetes consumer and a future function consumer at once.

**The consumption contract is startup configuration.** Sol makes the values a unit requires available
**before the application initializes**, through the existing environment and file interfaces. Code that
reads an input at startup keeps working unchanged.

**Making that contract hold at runtime is the runtime's bootstrap work — it is not a transparency
claim.** A runtime that retrieves values from a secret store must retrieve them *before* the
application reads them; exposing a retrieval API does not make an existing environment read retrieve.
An execution role that authorizes secret retrieval is also not the same mechanism as identity-based
authentication to a database; each lives in its own connection implementation.

**Refreshable credentials are a separate connection behavior**, added when a real consumer requires one.
The startup contract does not promise transparent rotation through an interface that reads a value once.

- **Kubernetes.** Projections are per consuming namespace. The renderer chooses the object kind, name,
  mount and reference path; **the object kind is a delivery detail, not an architectural rule** — a
  public CA may travel in a Secret because the delivery controller materializes Secrets.
- **Local development.** The same bindings, delivered as process environment, with only the inputs a
  unit consumes; a missing required value fails explicitly. Local Kafka is plaintext, so no credential
  or CA is required or projected.
- **A future runtime.** The same declarations; the runtime supplies its own access, retrieval and
  initialization, satisfying the startup contract. No backend plugin system is built to anticipate it.

## 5. Deployment, activation and rollback

**Target configuration owns current bindings and secret authority.**

**Rollback is historical application requirements + current target bindings → rollback inputs.** A
rollback restores the application release and resolves *its* named dependencies and application-secret
requirements against the target's **current** bindings; it does not restore an earlier credential
source. If the release is incompatible with the current bindings, the rollback **fails explicitly**.
**Infrastructure ownership changes stay outside application rollback** — rolling back code never
re-provisions or relinquishes a database. Historical references may remain as evidence, and never
silently become the authority again.

- **One writer owns each delivered object**; a switch of writer does not delete the previous object
  until consumers are redirected.
- **Planning checks declared requirements and supported combinations** before anything is applied.
- **Execution establishes the required delivery and readiness evidence** before a workload is up.
- **Updating a source, delivering its value, and activating it are three distinct outcomes.** For
  startup-environment delivery, a changed value reaches a running process only after a restart.

Projection reconciliation is idempotent and ownership-safe:

| Situation | Required behaviour |
|---|---|
| Source unavailable | Fail before mutating the projection |
| Projection missing / stale | Create / update it |
| Projection ownership unknown | Refuse adoption |
| One namespace succeeds, another fails | Report the partial failure, naming the namespace |
| Reconciliation interrupted | A subsequent reconcile repeats the operation safely |

Removals stay conservative: obsolete objects are **reported, never silently deleted**, and objects of
uncertain ownership are left in place.

**The stable guarantee:** a unit's declaration, code and connection interface — the **names, types and
semantics** of the inputs it reads — do not change when a resource's implementation changes. **Values
necessarily change** with an endpoint or credential, and generated names, paths, mounts and wiring may
change too. A provider that cannot satisfy a resource's connection contract is refused at plan, rather
than met with a provider-specific consumer or a generic adapter.

## 6. The boundary a new resource or runtime implements

**A new resource type** requires exactly three things, and nothing else: a typed connection shape in the
deployment model; a way to satisfy it (a provisioner, or an external binding); and a delivery
translation. Sol does not have to provision the resource for the type to be supported — a Sol-owned
consumer contract plus an implemented delivery path is enough.

**A new runtime** requires translating the model's connection semantics into that runtime's inputs, and
satisfying the startup contract (§4).

Non-goals, stated so a diff can be checked against them: no capability registry, runtime registration,
independent inventory or generic plugin framework; no provider-specific consumer branches; no precedence
rule for inputs; no resource DSL or parallel configuration of existing resources; no independent
reconciliation lifecycle (reconciliation stays part of target installation and the existing deployment
prerequisite handling); no migration controller, rotation controller or garbage collector; no
environment-wide impact analysis.

**Implementation discipline.** Each PR states **what it replaces** — which existing module, command,
flag, default or code path it removes or rewrites. The check is at the change level, not per new type.

## 7. Acceptance set

1. **Dependency-scoped delivery** — an input reaches a unit only for a dependency or application secret
   that unit declared.
2. **Unit isolation** — no cross-unit leakage.
3. **One producer per input** — conflicting producers fail at plan, naming both.
4. **Stable interface** — input names, types and semantics are unchanged across implementations; values
   and generated wiring may change; no provider branch in the consumer.
5. **Resource identity preserved** in the binding and the recorded evidence.
6. **References, not values** — plans, records, GitOps output and diagnostics carry no confidential value.
7. **Pending versus invalid** — distinct outcomes with distinct diagnostics.
8. **One writer per delivered object.**
9. **Atomic selection** — an override replaces ownership, sources and connection together, while
   unrelated attributes still merge as before.
10. **Ownership transitions are refused** for an existing managed resource; a binding change never
    produces a silent deletion plan.
11. **Rollback uses current bindings** — historical requirements against current target bindings;
    incompatibility fails explicitly; infrastructure ownership is untouched.
12. **No dangling references** — reconciliation is repeatable after interruption, and an incomplete
    operation never reports success. Removing a `uses` edge removes inputs and never deletes the
    resource.
13. **Every value has a named source** — no placeholder, and no fallback default when the source is absent.
14. **No additional authority** — a projection never becomes an independent source of credential authority.
15. **Observable resolution** — plan and status show the resolved source for each input and whether it
    was declared at the environment or the target; no internal representation is prescribed.
16. **Resolution is consistent** — availability, requirements and what the infrastructure actually
    provisions agree for the selected target.
17. **Partial failure is reported**, naming the affected namespace; never target-wide success.
18. **Unsupported combinations are refused at plan** — an unknown resource type, a provider that cannot
    satisfy the connection contract, or an unsupported resource count.
19. **Credential class isolation** — each consumer receives only the credential class its role implies:
    a workload's delivered inputs never include the provisioning or DDL credential, and the migration Job
    never receives the DML credential.

## 8. Out of scope

More than one provisioned database per target; multi-target sharing of a resource; capability types
beyond the concrete PostgreSQL and Kafka connections Sol supports today; automatic rotation; cross-cloud
portability; environment-wide change reports.

Implementation reality is tracked where it belongs: **#1344** carries the `@platform` retirement, the
migration sequence, the v1 delivery support matrix and the current provider defects; **#1360** carries
the authoritative-storage decision. The GitOps limitation is **temporary** — resource ownership does not
determine delivery capability; the flow cannot yet establish prerequisite readiness for
installation-owned projections, and that is an implementation gap, not a model rule.
