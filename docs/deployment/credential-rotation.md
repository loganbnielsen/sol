# Production workload credentials and rotation (SEC-004)

Two guarantees for `production-single-region`:

1. **No ambient Kubernetes credential.** A workload receives no mounted
   service-account token unless a declared capability requires one.
2. **Supported runtime credentials rotate without undefined behavior.** A
   rotated database/API credential is used by the workload, the old value is
   revoked, and the workload returns to healthy state — without hand-editing
   generated manifests.

## No ambient token

Every Sol-rendered workload uses a per-workload ServiceAccount, and the renderer
sets `automountServiceAccountToken: false` on it
(`Sol_cli_manifest_yaml.service_account_doc`). Because the token is projected
into the pod only when the ServiceAccount permits it, a default workload pod has
no Kubernetes API token and no in-cluster API access.

This is a Sol-owned property of the rendered plan, so the profile preflight's
`credential_posture` guarantee is established for every plan. Maturity A ships
**no** opt-back-in capability: exposing a "this workload may call the Kubernetes
API" knob without a meaningful least-privilege permission model would be worse
than not offering it, so it is deferred until a concrete workload needs one.
(Workload identity federation, service-to-service authorization, admission
policy and multi-team RBAC remain out of maturity A per DEC-026 §7.)

## Rotation: preserve each consumer's scope

Application values are stored in a unit's own `<unit>-secrets` object. Set or
rotate one with the target and exact `domain/unit/key` address:

```bash
your-secret-tool get payment-api-key \
  | sol secret set prod/aws/us-east-1 payments/charge_svc/PAYMENT_API_KEY --from-stdin
```

Sol resolves the target and the key's declared authority before opening the
input. It refuses external keys before reading a value. A changed value updates
only that unit's Secret; for a long-running service or worker, Sol restarts that
unit and waits for rollout readiness. It neither updates `sol-secrets` nor writes
to another unit. Secret values are redacted from command output.

Platform credentials used by Sol's internal Jobs have a separate target scope.
For example, migrations read `POSTGRES_URL` from `sol-secrets`:

```bash
your-secret-tool get production-postgres-url \
  | sol secret set prod/aws/us-east-1 @platform/POSTGRES_URL --from-stdin
```

For SASL_SSL targets, the contract Job also requires the platform Kafka
password and CA certificate. Platform writes update only `sol-secrets` objects
in active target namespaces; they never copy values into application Secrets or
restart application workloads. `sol secret status TARGET` reports key owners
and presence without printing values.

### Deploy and rollback

Deploy and rollback preserve secret values. They verify required unit Secrets
and the shared platform inputs needed by the operation. In M1, a required key
declared `external` causes remote deployment to fail explicitly; it is never
delivered through a legacy placeholder or Sol-owned write. ESO delivery is a
later milestone.

Sol-owned unit and platform values update their existing Kubernetes Secret in
place. A later deploy cannot restore a previous value from CI or a local shell.
Required platform inputs cannot be deleted while the target's Sol Jobs require
them; TLS-only Kafka inputs can be removed after the target no longer uses TLS.

## What is deliberately out of scope

- **A Kubernetes-API-access capability.** No maturity-A workload may have
  ambient API access; adding a narrow Role/RoleBinding grant needs a concrete
  capability and a least-privilege permission set first.
- **File-mounted secret refresh.** The env-var contract is kept, so kubelet's
  file-refresh behavior is not relied on.
- **Versioned secret names.** Names churn and leak history; in-place update plus
  restart is simpler and auditable.
- **Build-time secrets** (FEAT-053) — a different lifecycle, not a substitute
  for runtime rotation.
