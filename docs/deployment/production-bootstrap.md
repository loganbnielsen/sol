# Production state bootstrap, identities and recovery (AUDIT-072)

`production-single-region` requires infrastructure state that is encrypted,
versioned and locked, and named provisioning/deploy/operator identities distinct
from the cluster-creator admin. This is the AWS bootstrap for the one qualified
provider; provider parity is not part of maturity A.

Implementation and offline validation live here; the destructive recovery and
authorization checks are HARDEN-002's.

## 1. Provision the state backend (Sol provisions it by default)

A Terraform configuration cannot create its own backend, so the backend is a
small separate root:

```bash
cd platform/infra/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply \
  -var="region=us-east-1" \
  -var="state_bucket=<globally-unique-name>" \
  -var="state_lock_table=<name>"
```

It creates:

- an S3 bucket with **versioning**, **AES256 encryption** and a full
  **public-access block** — object versioning is the recovery mechanism;
- a **DynamoDB lock table** (`LockID`) so two concurrent applies serialize or
  one is rejected without corrupting state.

Bring-your-own is a documented alternative: any backend with the same
properties (encrypted, versioned, locked) is conformant. Record it in the target
so preflight can verify it:

```yaml
target:
  profile: production-single-region
  state_bucket: acme-tfstate
  letsencrypt_email: ops@acme.example
  aws:
    state_lock_table: acme-tflock
```

Provider-native settings — the lock table here, the role ARNs below — live in the
target's `aws:` block, so a target on another provider cannot carry them. A flat
`state_lock_table:` is refused with the key's new location.

`sol cloud` fails closed before Terraform initialization when either is missing.
It supplies this configuration at runtime and uses deterministic, distinct
`sol/<target>/cloud.tfstate` and `sol/<target>/platform.tfstate` objects. Do not
create a repository or operator-managed `backend.tf` for the normal lifecycle.

## 2. Identities: Sol generates the contracts, you supply the ARNs

The bootstrap root outputs four least-privilege policy documents
(`provisioner_policy_json`, `publisher_policy_json`, `deploy_policy_json`,
`operator_policy_json`). Sol owns the *contract*; it does not create roles,
attach policies, or manage their lifecycle. Create the roles in your account
and declare the three ARNs `sol deploy` actually reads:

```yaml
target:
  cluster_endpoint_cidr: 203.0.113.0/24
  aws:
    provisioner_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sol-provisioner
    cluster_access_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sol-cluster-access
    deploy_role_arn:      arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sol-deploy
    operator_role_arn:    arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sol-operator
```

The boundary the contracts encode:

- **provisioner** — a constrained high-privilege identity that creates/updates
  cloud and platform infrastructure, including the workspace's ECR
  repositories (their *lifecycle* — create/describe/tag — never the data-plane
  actions that would let it push an image into one; that deny is explicit in
  the generated policy, not just an omission). Its direct Kubernetes grants
  cover the supported platform lifecycle in platform namespaces and exclude
  ordinary application mutation elsewhere; CRD/controller authority still
  makes it a powerful infrastructure trust domain;
- **publisher** — may push/replace images in the workspace's ECR repositories
  (`ecr:PutImage` and its supporting layer-upload actions) and nothing else;
  explicitly denied infrastructure, IAM, and repository-lifecycle mutation, so
  publishing an image cannot also grant provisioning or deploy authority. No
  target field names this ARN — Sol's own execution never resolves it.
  `sol up` never touches AWS at all (local-only, no target concept); a CI
  pipeline authenticates as this identity for its own `docker push` step,
  entirely outside Sol, before calling `sol deploy` with the resulting digest;
- **deploy** — may `DescribeCluster` and mutate application objects through a
  namespace-scoped EKS access entry. It explicitly **denies** infrastructure and
  IAM mutation and any attempt to grant itself cluster administration, so it
  cannot escalate;
- **operator** — owns **production observation and diagnosis** (DEC-038). Its
  generated AWS policy is read-only (`eks:DescribeCluster`, `eks:ListClusters`,
  plus the state bucket), which is enough to obtain a kubeconfig; `sol cloud
  apply` then creates the EKS access entry (Kubernetes group `sol:operators`) and
  a `sol-operator-diagnostics` `ClusterRole`, bound per application namespace at
  runtime exactly like deploy's. The grant is `get`/`list` on **only** the
  resources Sol's read-only commands read — pods, pods/log, services, events,
  deployments, cronjobs, and namespaces — so `sol status` can explain an
  unhealthy workload *including its events*. It deliberately has **no** mutating
  verb, no `secrets`, and no `pods/exec` or `pods/portforward`: interactive
  debugging is not diagnosis, and a future command that needs those must justify
  them rather than inherit them.

`sol deploy` fails closed unless the three ARNs it reads (provisioner, deploy,
operator) are present and the public API endpoint is restricted to an
explicit CIDR (`0.0.0.0/0` is rejected). A public endpoint with an explicit
CIDR allowlist is acceptable for maturity A;
private-only networking is a stronger future posture.

### Configuring kubectl for the deploy identity

`sol cloud apply` wires `deploy_role_arn` into an EKS access entry (Kubernetes
group `sol:deployers`) and a cluster-wide `sol-deploy` `ClusterRole`; the
namespace-scoped `RoleBinding` that actually grants it is applied per
application namespace at deploy time (`Sol_cli_substrate.ensure`), not by
Terraform, since application namespaces are created dynamically. Once the role
exists and `deploy_role_arn` is set, `sol cloud apply`'s output prints the
command to run — Sol does not write your kubeconfig or the target file for
you (AUDIT-072: Sol owns the IAM policy contract, not your local kubeconfig
or role lifecycle):

```
deploy_kubeconfig_command   aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name <cluster> --alias <cluster>-deploy --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/sol-deploy
deploy_kube_context         <cluster>-deploy
```

Run the printed command, then add the printed context name to the target:

```yaml
target:
  kube_context: <cluster>-deploy
```

## 3. No standing cluster-creator admin

The AWS module sets `enable_cluster_creator_admin_permissions = false`. During
`sol cloud apply`, the separate cluster-access identity holds temporary EKS bootstrap admin
access for the whole privileged `PlatformInstalling` phase — the full platform
apply and verified readiness — because installing cluster-wide software that
mints RBAC is itself privileged platform establishment (ADR 0003). Sol then
removes the managed admin association and verifies the effective positive and
negative RBAC boundary. Its IAM policy permits cluster discovery and credential
retrieval but explicitly denies access-entry/policy-association and all `iam:*`
mutation, so the steady-state identity cannot recreate that grant. The cloud
provisioner remains responsible for substrate and bootstrap-access mutation. An interrupted
run is safely re-runnable and reconciles that temporary association away; it is
not the steady-state access model.

## 4. Recovery procedure

Control-state RTO is procedure-based, not a numeric bound (DEC-026 §5).

**Recover a clean runner** (original runner and local files gone):

```bash
sol cloud plan prod/aws/us-east-1
sol cloud apply prod/aws/us-east-1
```

**Recover a prior state object version** (bad apply, or corrupted state):

```bash
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket <bucket> --prefix sol/prod/aws/us-east-1/
aws s3api get-object --bucket <bucket> --key sol/prod/aws/us-east-1/cloud.tfstate \
  --version-id <version-id> /tmp/tfstate.recovered
# Inspect, then restore the chosen version explicitly — never in place blindly.
```

**Two concurrent mutations** serialize through the lock table. A held lock is
not stale merely because the `sol` that started it has exited (see below): only
force-unlock after establishing that no Terraform process anywhere still holds
it. Unlocking a live lock is how GCP qualification Attempt 6 ended up with a
cluster the provider had and the state did not.

**Interrupting `sol cloud` (INFRA-076).** Sol runs Terraform under a supervisor
in a session of its own, with its output in a durable operation record under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/sol/operations/` (default `~/.local/share/sol/operations/`), so:

- **Ctrl-C** (or SIGTERM/SIGHUP to `sol`) sends one SIGINT to Terraform only,
  never to its provider plugins, and Sol waits while Terraform stops itself:
  persisting state and releasing the lock. A second Ctrl-C asks Terraform to
  cancel immediately, which Terraform warns may lose data.
- **If `sol` itself dies** (killed, out of memory, terminal closed), Terraform
  keeps running to completion and records its outcome. `sol` exiting does not
  mean Terraform exited.
- **The next `sol cloud` command reads the last operation against that state:**
  - *still running* → refused. Wait for it; do not unlock.
  - *resolved*, including a graceful Ctrl-C → proceeds normally.
  - *unresolved* (Terraform was killed by a signal, its supervisor vanished, or it
    left `errored.tfstate`) → `apply` is refused until you reconcile: inspect the
    provider and the state, import or remove what diverged, and push any
    `errored.tfstate` yourself. Then re-run with `--accept-unresolved`.
    `plan` and `destroy` proceed with a warning.

## Evidence HARDEN-002 records

- two concurrent applies serialize or one is rejected without corrupting state;
- a clean runner recovers the backend and plans with no unintended recreation;
- recovery from a prior backend object version is exercised;
- the deploy identity is denied an infrastructure mutation and a self-granted
  admin policy;
- the ordinary operator path does not use the cluster-creator credential;
- one infrastructure and one application mutation are attributed to their named
  principal in retained audit evidence.

## Credentials and Terraform variable ownership

Two things learned by qualifying a real target (HARDEN-002 run 1), both now
enforced in code rather than in an operator's memory.

**The database master password is supplied out of band.** The provider root
creates the RDS instance, so it needs a master password before any workload
exists. Supply it through the environment, never as a Terraform variable on the
command line:

```bash
TF_VAR_db_password="$(your-secret-tool get sol-db-password)" \
  sol cloud apply prod/aws/us-east-1
```

Sol refuses an apply that would create Postgres with no credential source, and
refuses a password passed with `--var` — the run log records the terraform
command line verbatim, so the value would be written to a file. The module
carries the same precondition on `aws_db_instance.postgres`, so the constraint
holds even when terraform is driven directly. Nothing writes the password to a
plan, an output, a log or a release record; the module's `postgres_url` output
(which does contain it) is `sensitive`, and it exists so an operator can place
the connection string in their secret store for the runtime Secret that
workloads read as `POSTGRES_URL`.

**`cluster_issuer` belongs to the base platform layer.** `sol cloud plan/apply/
destroy` pass each Terraform root only the variables it declares.
`cluster_issuer` names a cert-manager `ClusterIssuer`, so Sol routes it to
`platform/infra/base` after the cloud output contract has been validated.

It remains a target field (`sol deploy` uses it for ingress annotations). Passing
it to the provider root, as it used to be, made terraform abort with "a variable
named cluster_issuer was assigned on the command line, but the root module does
not declare a variable of that name" — so a documented target using it could not
provision at all.

## Platform storage (finding 7 of HARDEN-002 run 2)

The qualified substrate must be able to host the platform's own durable
components. Two layers provide that, and neither is an application workload volume:

- **Cloud substrate**: on AWS (`platform/infra/aws`) this installs the **EBS
  CSI driver** as an EKS addon, with an IRSA role scoped to
  `kube-system:ebs-csi-controller-sa`. Without it an EKS cluster has no CSI
  driver and therefore no StorageClass, so every PVC stays `Pending`. On GCP the
  `pd.csi.storage.gke.io` driver is part of GKE itself and needs no addon.
- **Platform substrate** (`platform/infra/base`) creates the default **gp3
  StorageClass** on AWS (`WaitForFirstConsumer`, so the volume is created in the
  zone the pod lands in). Set `create_storage_class = false` if the platform is
  expected to adopt a class that already exists, or `storage_class_name` to rename
  it.
- **On GCP the module creates no class and adopts GKE's own default**
  (`standard-rwo`, provisioner `pd.csi.storage.gke.io`, `WaitForFirstConsumer`,
  `pd-balanced`). GKE already annotates it as the default, and the platform's PVCs
  name no `storageClassName`, so they bind to whatever the cluster calls default.
  Creating a second default class would leave the cluster with two, which
  Kubernetes accepts with a warning and then resolves arbitrarily. Persistent
  Disks are encrypted at rest with Google-managed keys by default, so the posture
  the AWS class states explicitly (`encrypted = "true"`) holds here without a
  parameter.

`Ready` asserts the outcome for either provider rather than trusting the
configuration that produced it: the provider's class is the *sole* default
StorageClass on the cluster and is backed by the provider's block-storage CSI
driver, which is registered (`Sol_cli_cloud_lifecycle.platform_storage`). A
cluster whose default is some other class, or whose default is ambiguous, is
`Unmet` — the platform's durable volumes are then not on the class Sol intends.

This is what makes Redpanda's RF≥3 persistent brokers schedulable. It changes
nothing about how a workload declares persistence: the `single`-tier restriction
DEC-026 §3 puts on workload-declared volumes is unaffected, because the driver and
the class are platform capabilities, not a workload's storage claim.

Before run 2 the substrate had neither, and the only reason the repository's own
live smoke harness ever installed the platform was that it disabled persistence
(`-var=redpanda_persistent_storage=false`).

## Platform roots are selected per provider

The platform *definition* is `platform/infra/base`. A Terraform root's state
backend *type* is part of its own configuration — `-backend-config` sets
attributes, never the type — so one root cannot serve both the S3 backend AWS
needs and the GCS backend GCP needs. `sol cloud` therefore selects a root per
provider (`Sol_cli_cloud_lifecycle.platform_root`):

| Provider | Root | Backend | Platform state object |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | `platform/infra/base` | S3 + DynamoDB locking | `sol/<target>/platform.tfstate` (`key=`) |
| GCP | `platform/infra/base-gcp` | GCS, native locking | `sol/<target>/platform.tfstate` (`prefix=`) |

`base-gcp` declares only the GCS backend and a module call into `base`, so the
definition itself is not duplicated. Two consequences are worth knowing before
editing either:

- A module's own `terraform` block is ignored, so `terraform init` on `base-gcp`
  warns about `base`'s S3 backend and provider requirements. That is expected —
  the root's backend is the one used, and supplying it is the whole reason the
  root exists.
- The GCP root mirrors every variable in the definition except the AWS-shaped
  ones — `aws_region`, the S3 buckets and their IRSA roles, and
  `cert_manager_irsa_role_arn`, none of which a GCP install can use. Adding a
  variable to the definition without adding it to `base-gcp` fails
  `cli/sol/test/check_production_infra.sh` rather than silently defaulting on GCP.

Everything a target addresses inside the platform root goes through
`Sol_cli_cloud_lifecycle.platform_address`, because a root that reaches the
definition through a module addresses its resources through it
(`module.platform.<resource>`) while AWS's does not.

## Destroying a target (finding 9 of HARDEN-002 run 2)

Production RDS deletion protection stays **on** by default; that is correct and is
not relaxed for convenience. Destruction is an explicit lifecycle:

1. the operator confirms the target is disposable;
2. deletion protection is disabled **by an applied state transition** — either
   `terraform apply -var=rds_deletion_protection=false` or `aws rds
   modify-db-instance --no-deletion-protection`, followed by waiting for the
   instance to leave `modifying`;
3. Terraform takes a final snapshot. The module sets `final_snapshot_identifier`
   whenever it will take one, defaulting to `<cluster>-postgres-final`. RDS requires
   snapshot names to be unique, so destroying the same cluster name a second time
   needs a fresh `rds_final_snapshot_identifier` **applied in the same step as 2** —
   otherwise the delete fails with `DBSnapshotAlreadyExists`;
4. `terraform destroy` completes;
5. absence is verified. For what Terraform manages (EKS, RDS, ECR, the VPC with its
   NAT gateways and elastic IPs), a successful `terraform destroy` plus an empty
   state is the authority (DEC-045). `sol cloud destroy` additionally checks what
   Terraform does not own: load balancers created by the in-cluster cloud
   controller, and target-tagged EBS volumes created for PersistentVolumeClaims. It
   fails closed when any of those queries errors or returns a resource. The live
   smoke harness (`internal/qualification/aws/live-smoke.sh`) keeps its own
   independent inventory, including the VPC, as qualification evidence.
   Volumes are worth the operator's attention from this release onward: the EBS
   CSI driver and default gp3 StorageClass (see *Platform storage* above) are what
   first make dynamically provisioned EBS volumes possible on this substrate. The
   class reclaims with `Delete`, but that only fires when the *PVC* is deleted
   through the API — tearing the cluster down without doing so leaves the volumes
   behind.

Passing `-var` to `terraform destroy` does **not** accomplish step 2 or 3. A destroy
plan contains only deletes, so the provider is handed prior state and never sees the
new value: `terraform plan -destroy -var x=B` on an applied `x = "A"` plans
`input = "A" -> null`. Both settings have to be applied *before* the destroy.

**Known gap:** `sol cloud destroy` therefore cannot yet destroy a protected
production RDS instance. It runs the destroy only; it performs no preparatory
transition, and a `-var` it forwarded would be inert for the reason above. Until the
preparation step exists, the operator performs steps 2 and 3 directly (via
`terraform apply` or the `aws` CLI) and may then use either `terraform destroy` or
`sol cloud destroy <target> --apply`.

What is fixed here is the Terraform-level defect: `skip_final_snapshot` is no longer
derived from `deletion_protection` — so permitting destruction no longer means
silently forgoing the final snapshot — and an identifier is always set when a
snapshot will be taken, so Terraform no longer refuses the destroy outright.
`sol cloud destroy` now runs the Sol lifecycle skeleton (prepare → verify the
preparation landed → destroy platform → destroy cloud → verify absence); its AWS
preparation is a declared no-op until finding 9b supplies the RDS
deletion-protection transition and a unique snapshot identity per attempt. Until
then, steps 2 and 3 above remain the operator's explicit path.
